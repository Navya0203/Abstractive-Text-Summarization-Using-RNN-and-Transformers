It's perfect for luring in curious children. But when volunteers get kids past the upside-down coyote hanging from the ceiling and the owl with an elephant trunk, they shape young minds with after-school tutoring, writing workshops and books written by kids. \\\"I think the kids are tricked in and then, as they are talking to the person at the front desk, they are learning about what's going on in the tutoring center,\\\" said Gerald Richards, the chief executive of 826 National, the nonprofit network of tutoring centers that look nothing like classrooms. The Washington \\\"museum,\\\" which set up shop in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in October, was the latest branch to open. Each of the eight centers has an imaginative storefront that helps raise money and encourage creativity among students. In Seattle, kids are lured into the writing lab by the Greenwood Space Travel Supply Co., which sells intergalactic peace treaties and travel cups. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, Liberty Street Robot Supply & Repair sells robot emotion upgrades, fruit powered clocks and robodentures. The original chapter opened eight years ago at 826 Valencia St. in San Francisco's Mission District. (As it spread, the original address inspired the name 826 National.) It was co-founded by Dave Eggers, author of \\\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,\\\" and founder of the publishing house, McSweeney's. Early on, organizers at 826 Valencia St. learned the space they'd rented was zoned for retail, so they needed to come up with something to sell. The space looked a bit like an old pirate ship. \\\"Someone thought, 'Why don't we sell pirate gear and see what happens?'\\\" Richards said. Since then, it has been fronted by The Pirate Supply Store, where shoppers can purchase hooks, peg legs and plank-by-the-foot. Now, Richards said, profits from stores account for 20 percent of the teaching that goes on in the writing center. And the imagination enticements work. 826 National is on track to serve 24,000 students this year through its tutoring centers and school outreach programs. Sisters Teah and Janea Green have been visiting 826DC most afternoons since it opened. \\\"This place is awesome,\\\" said Janea, 10, as she worked on her multiplication homework with volunteer Matt Lemanski. \\\"I really, really need help with my homework and my parents are busy sometimes.\\\" \\\"Sometimes we do poetry, sometimes we do math,\\\" said Teah, 9. When she doesn't have homework, she works on the story she is writing about a mermaid named Katopia. Writing is the primary focus at 826 centers, which also work with middle school and high school students. It also publishes books written by students. Their latest, \\\"I Live Real Close to Where You Used to Live,\\\" is a collection of student letters to First Lady Michelle Obama. It will be in bookstores on December 15. The letters run the gamut from asking if Obama cooks with an Easy-Bake Oven at the White House, to a suggestion that she use robots to keep drugs off the streets. The book is a companion to one that came out last year that contains letters to President Barack Obama, \\\"Thanks and Have Fun Running the Country.\\\" Profits from the book sales are used to support the tutoring centers. Kathleen Yancey, an English professor at Florida State University, said the 826 National centers complement the learning that goes on in classrooms. Schools are about college and job readiness, and tests that prove it, Yancey said. Those demands don't leave much time for playful reading or imaginative writing, even if it could help some students learn. \\\"If you want people to engage in activity, you find a way for them to have fun with it. 826 is a genius at that,\\\" said Yancey, a past president of the National Council of Teachers of English. \\\"If [students] don't take any pleasure in it, they won't actually practice it. When they have fun, they won't quit on you.\\\" Fun is what draws students in, too. \\\"It's OK to be strange,\\\" said Richards, the 826 leader. \\\"It's OK to be magical, it's OK to be whimsical.\\\"\",\n          \"The Twelve Days Of Christmas don't have much appeal to the modern woman - most ladies these days would prefer a cashmere sweater or a designer handbag to a partridge in a pear tree.

A childhood friend of embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has been dragged into the Bridgegate scandal, with emails revealing he gave a key Port Authority official a tour of the traffic chaos. In the latest twist, emails show Port Authority police officer Thomas 'Chip' Michaels was on the George Washington Bridge with David Wildstein, the official who ordered the road closures, when the disaster unfolded. The messages also reveal Michaels was aware of the plan to flood Fort Lee with traffic the . day before the controversial lane closings in September last year and kept Wildstein updated. It is not clear if Michaels will be implicated in the scandal. Thrown under the bus: It has been revealed that Chris Christie's long time friend, Port Authority police officer Thomas 'Chip' Michaels (left), was involved in the infamous George Washington Bridge lane closures . They go way back: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (pictured) and Thomas Michaels reportedly grew up together in Livingston, New Jersey, and Michaels recently coached Christie's son in little league hockey . Michaels grew up with Christie in Livingston and even coached the Governor's son in Little League hockey. He joined the Port Authority Police Department in 1998, according to payroll records. The troubling emails were today released by MSNBC's Steve Kornacki and can be found at the bottom of this page. On September 8, a day before the lane closures, Michaels emailed . Port Authority Captain Darcy Licorish, asking, 'Is there going to be a new . traffic pattern installed for Monday the 9th?' In a 7.28am email on the first day of the traffic snarl, Wildstein informed Robert Durando, general manager of the bridge, 'Going to take a ride with chip and see how it looks.' 'Want me to pik u up. Its fkd up here (sic),' Michaels, a 15-year Port Authority officer, told Wildstein in a text before the tour. Michaels later texted Wildstein, 'I may have idea to mak ths beter (sic)'. The text-message exchanges between . Michaels and Wildstein were included in documents subpoenaed by a New . Jersey legislative committee investigating the bridge scandal. Scandalous: Emails released today show Michaels took David Wildstein (pictured) on a tour of the George Washington Bridge traffic snarl . The Fort Lee lane closure scandal has thrown Christie's presidential campaign into disarray, with mounting evidence showing his appointees conspired to . create traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey on September 9 last year. The problems began after two toll lanes at a New . York-bound, toll plaza entrance to the George Washington . Bridge were closed to traffic from . Fort Lee before rush hour. The closures caused massive traffic snarls for days. Various reasons for the closure have been reported, including that it was political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not endorsing Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. The Fort Lee lane closure scandal: Evidence shows appointees of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie conspired to create traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey, starting at a New York-bound, toll plaza entrance to the George Washington Bridge (pictured) Christie has repeatedly denied knowing of the bridge debacle until it was over. But Wildstein's . lawyer has recently claim that 'evidence exists' Christie knew of the . lane closures while they were occurring. Wildstein resigned in December. Meanwhile, Michaels' brother, Jeffrey Michaels, is a top Republican lobbyist whose business Optimus Partners L.L.C. has flourished under the Christie administration. MSNBC reported Jeffrey Michaels served as the chief of staff to Republican Gov. Donald DiFrancesco just . over a decade ago before transitioning into lobbying. He also advised Christie in his 2009 run for governor. 'I\\u2019ve known him for a long time,' Jeffrey Michaels said in a TV interview after the campaign. 'We went to high school with \\u2013 we \\u2013 our families knew each other . from Livingston, and just stayed in close contact with him over the . years and was very pleased to help his campaign out with policy.' Local . reports and I.R.S. filings show Jeffrey Michaels has donated . extensively to pro-Christie groups. The donations include $25,000 to a PAC-created . to push the governor\\u2019s agenda and $20,450 since October 2012 to the . Republican Governors Association, which Christie heads.
